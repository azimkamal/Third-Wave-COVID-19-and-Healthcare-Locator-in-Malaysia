# Third-Wave-COVID-19-and-Healthcare-Locator-in-Malaysia

Malaysia has flattened the Covid-19 curved in late May or early June 2020. During that time, Malaysia’s Government has introduced the Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO), stating that we are at the recovery phase after the Covid-19 outbreak in Malaysia. In late September, Malaysia entered the Third Wave Covid-19 phase where there is a huge spike of cases that is originated from Sabah and subsequently were spread throughout the country.
